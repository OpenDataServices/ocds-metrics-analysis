OCDS Metrics Analysis
=====================

`Open Contracting data <https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/>`_ allows Metrics to be attached with Metrics and Observations,
`as defined in the metrics extension <https://extensions.open-contracting.org/en/extensions/metrics/>`_.

**This Python library provides classes to create, read, and query data in Metrics and Observations data objects.**

It can be used in a `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ or `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/>`_ notebook.
